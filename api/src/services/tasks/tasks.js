  //| rent date and with no tasks - e.g. it's not a new day if you |
  //| have already used the app and tasks exist. Similarly, it is  |
  //| not a new day if tasks are completed or deleted. Then, it    |
  //| will roll tasks forward from the last date with tasks being  |
  //| present, up to six days in the immediate past.               |
  //|                                                              |

  //====================== TASK HANDLING ===========================
  //================================================================
  //| Tasks are defined to be "on some day" if tasks have a        |
  //| date field that falls in the range of 05:00:00 on a certain  |
  //| day (inclusive) to 05:00:00 on the next day (exclusive). Any |
  //| task which is marked as either 4 (Completed) or 5 (Deleted)  |
  //| will not be rolled over. However, for the purposes of decid- |
  //| ing a new day, we can assume that if tasks exist, *even if   |
  //| they are of status 4 or 5, it is not a new day*. This is     |
  //| because this function would have already run prior to the    |
  //| creation of those tasks.                                     |
  //================================================================

      //| number of tasks of which none need to be rolled over. This   |
      //| is impossible because if you made tasks that day which were  |
      //| marked as completed or deleted, this algorithm would have    |
      //| already run. Therefore, that list would contain the tasks    |
      //| you want behind it, too, because they'd have been caught     |
      //| already by this algorithm. Free will isn't real.             |
      //================================================================
