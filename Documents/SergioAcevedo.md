# Readme

Sergio Acevedo, security team (08) readme file.
Teammates include Dhruvil Kansara, and Thomas Bethea.

Worked with Dhruv and Tom to get account creations/logins working properly. Doing research together/on our own, but most of the coding we did from Dhruv's computer.

I created a forgot-password feature where the user can input his/her e-mail. If the e-mail is in the database, a link with a reset token will be sent to the user to create a new password. If the inputed e-mail is not in the database, a 'user does not exist' error will be prompted to the user.
