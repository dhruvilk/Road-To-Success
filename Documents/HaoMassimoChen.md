|$${\color{lightgreen}*\ Created\ this\ README}$$notes: made this file, and I'm in the Api team. Doing some research about it, but I doubt there will be actual stuff to do before having an actual webpage during the first couple weeks|$${\color{lightgreen}*\ Started\ to\ test\ GAPI\ }$$ Link: https://github.com/dhruvilk/Road-To-Success/commit/197ec00940a8372a695024da5178483fd01f0a5e did research about it and also tried to implement it. Tried to do it on local and then tested on redwood, but it couldn't work, so I moved on trying different things, such as other people implementations and packages.| $${\color{lightgreen}*\ Collaborated\ with\ Group\ Members}$$ at this point the professor showed his implementation of the Google Calendar, and explained more about the logic behind it. He used the code flow and used both front end and back end in his demo. Team API is splitted into 2 groups. Lazar and Shumsher are working on "local services", and Mike and I were still working on the Google Calendar. At this point Mike took the lead, did the majority of the code work, tried to implement the professor code, and succeded by also implementing the native login, and storing the tokens to the db. I tested and met with him to understand and discuss about the following actions to take. I also gave suggestions to Security team in discord since they were struggling with the Google Login.| $${\color{lightgreen}*\ Encryption\ Decryption\ Services\ }$$ implemented the funtion to Encrypt and Deprypt strings. Other group members can use the service now. The next step is to use these functions to try encrypt the tokens stored in the db. First couple tries failed since the whole response is too long after encryption. I will try to encrypt just access token and refresh token next.
|$${\color{lightgreen}*\ Modified\ prisma\ file\ }$$ Link: https://github.com/dhruvilk/Road-To-Success/commit/3c7465a283d1ec93e650f9b2aa0669d41239df7a| $${\color{lightgreen}*\ Get\ Credentials\ with\ Google\ Login\ }$$ I was able to have a Google Login using a react component. With this Login, I was able to log the google user credentials response. I tried both code and implicit Oauth flows, but I will later proceed with implicit flow, so i could see the results immediately. This package, and part of this code will be later used by security team. Link: https://github.com/dhruvilk/Road-To-Success/commit/af2d5e984bd62f10fd2a5d4b265a23e87eb70b08
|$${\color{lightgreen}*\ Updated\ prisma\ file\ }$$ Link: https://github.com/dhruvilk/Road-To-Success/commit/95dbea11496425c974f4b88150050971fda00544| $${\color{lightgreen}*\ Get\ Access\ Token\ with\ Google\ Login\ }$$ I was able to show all my events from my google calendar now since I had the access token. This logic, it would work, but it is all from the front end. Prof suggested to have code flow involving our backend. The code was shown during the demo for sprint2 (when all API team went up).
