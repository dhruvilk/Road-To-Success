I initialized the repo and did everything. Next week idk what we'll do


For the week of 10/26 I am going to start working on the security aspect. We've figured out what we're going to use
which is auth0. I've been reading up on it and this thursday at night Team Kenny Security is meeting up to work on it

Did a bunch of reading on auth0. 

Set up auth0 in a separate branch yesterday(10/29)

Today on 10/30 team security will hop on and put the finishing touches on auth0. Get a home page up and running, get login and registration done(10/30)

Restarted our stuff from square 1 since we decided having two logins was kind of dumb

Week of 11/7 basically just struggled

Week of 11/14 we met with purab and figured out how it would work and actually got a login page up and running but it was in ts not js so uhhh yeah
11/17 got the js login stuff working

week of 11/21 i got the login button onto the landing page. it doesnt show logout or the user pfp like it should but eh nbd
11/23 started registration stuff

11/24 did nothing cuz thanksgiving duh

Had meeting about progress. With the help of mike we have a gorgeous login and registration functionality

Did a bunch of merges. We've got a good looking landing page and functionalities. Tom and Sergio have told me to step back and relax and let them put finishing touches instead of me worrying for a day. 


Meeting with purab about what security has left. im doing regex. Also meeting with purab and UI as it seems they have work to merge into master

Plan was changed. Tom and sergio will be working on regex, forgot password, email verification. I have been tasked with clean up by Purab. The following files were deleted within pull requests and commented out as to who had what.
